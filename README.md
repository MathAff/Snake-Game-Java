# About the project
Since I'm interested in game development, I started to search in the web for possible projects. That is just a begining, and I'm so excited to continue this journey.
Game development helps everyone improve the programming logics, so I guess its a good thing to do while I'm not working in some kind of big Project.
The credits for this code goes for Bro Code, wich I think is a pretty good content creator and helped me a lot in previous projects.

Hes youtube channel is (Bro Code)[https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez], and the video I got this project is: (Java snake game üêç)[https://www.youtu.be/bI6e6qjJ8JQ?si=74NyBOmOGEadZRsb]
